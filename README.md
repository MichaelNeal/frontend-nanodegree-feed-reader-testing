# Project Overview

This poject reflects a Jasmine test suite for a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The only file that has been edited from the original is feedreader.js located in jasmine/spec.

## Steps required to run the application

To run the Jasmine test, download all the project files and navigate to the index.html page in your web browser of choice. There are seven spec tests that run when the web page is loaded. To run any individual test, click on any line under the Jasmine__TopLevel__Suite heading in the Jasmine section.
